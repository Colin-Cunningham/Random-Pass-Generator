# Random-Pass-Generator
Generate a random secure password.

First Commit = Created the HTML using checkboxes instead of alerts to gather data, as well as organzing in multiple different sub classes.

Learned the meaning of "const" in regards to creating a constant variable in Java

Created the Functions for which the code will be run on, basically the retrival functions of random numbers, characters and such. 

Learned the meaning of "fromCharCode" and how those codes align with actual characters. 

Studied the important difference between "var", "let" and "const". 
    - Use "let" when defining a var within a block sequence, that you dont want passed up to the parent. 
    - Use "const" when creating a var that you want neither updated nor redeclared. 

Newest Commit
    - Created the functions in which the java becomes responsive to the HTML page (check boxes, etc.)
    - Used Parse Int (to transfer a string into a number) and .checked (a preperty which identifies if a box has been checked or not) for the first time.

Challenges ahead
    - Need to determine a tructure in which the createPass function will not only grab elements based off wether or not they were checked, but that also randomizes the order of said elements. 

Also decided to scrap my CSS becuase CSS is garbage and it hates me (may use bootstrap framework instead)
